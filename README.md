# Bozimer's Rage Game
Bozimer’s Rage Game is a minimalist 2D platformer where the environment is your only enemy.

Across five color-coded worlds, each with unique mechanics that build upon one another, you’ll face increasingly punishing platforming challenges. Every death teaches you something new, but Bozimer — the smug Rage Demon — will be there to mock your failures and remind you of his control.

Key Features:

Minimalist platforming challenge – No enemies, no combat, only environmental hazards.

Color-coded worlds – Five worlds inspired by reversed rainbow colors, each introducing new mechanics.

Progressive difficulty – Mechanics layer together for a brutal but rewarding final challenge.

Death as a teacher – Track your deaths at the end of each level to reflect and improve.

One final boss – Face Bozimer himself at the peak of the Soul Spire.

Do you have the patience to keep your cool, or will you become just another lost soul at Bozimer’s after-party?
